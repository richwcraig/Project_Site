Thanks for checking out my blog! My name is Richard Craig. I am a graduate student at Willamette University studying Data Science. This site is primarily for sharing my capstone project, but it will hopefully also be for other past and future projects. I am super passionate about Democrartic politics and hope that I can use data science to help our country. 

If you are Jameson here is [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to my main blogpost on voter registration in Oregon.
