### Cleaning the Data and Creating the Senate Datasets

You can find the most up to date Oregon voter registration data here:
https://data.oregon.gov/Administrative/Voter-Registration-Change-Over-Time/2ppg-zt4s

This next chunk in largely just cleaning up the data types and also selecting the correct rows of interest as the dataset contains many features that are just codes used by the state. 
```{r Cleaning Voter Dataset, message=FALSE}

voters_clean<-voters%>%
    mutate(Date=mdy(SYSDATE),House_District= as.factor(HD_CODE), Count=`COUNT(V.ID)`)%>%
    select(Date,House_District,PARTY,Count)%>%
    group_by(Date,House_District,PARTY)%>%
    mutate(Total_For_Party=sum(Count))

 voters_clean<-voters_clean%>%
   select(c(-Count))%>%
   unique()%>%
   arrange(Date)


voters_clean<-voters_clean%>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c("Date", "House_District"),names_from = PARTY, values_from = Total_For_Party)

voters_clean$`Americans Elect`[is.na(voters_clean$`Americans Elect`)] <- 0
voters_clean$`Non Partisan`[is.na(voters_clean$`Non Partisan`)] <- 0

voters_clean<-voters_clean%>%
  mutate(Other2=Other+`Working Families Party of Oregon`+Progressive+`Pacific Green`+Constitution+Libertarian+Other+`Americans Elect`+`Non Partisan`,
         District_Total = Democrat + Republican+ Other2+`Independent Party`+ Nonaffiliated)%>%
  select(Date,House_District, Democrat, Republican, Independent=`Independent Party`, Nonaffiliated,Other=Other2,District_Total)%>%
  drop_na()

```

This chunk was the bane of my existence for most of this project. As the dataset only contains the state house district, I needed to create a new column that was the Senate District. Thankfully, Oregon's senate districts are simply two house districts. For any data scientists looking at this post, yes, I could have done this with a loop or two. I will admit that I did not out of complete laziness. If you want to know why these five ditrcists were chosen, check out my blog post on the growth of non-affiliated voters in Oregon. 

```{r Creating Senate Districts, message=FALSE}
senate_clean <- voters_clean
senate_clean$Senate_District <- "None"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR13"] <- "SS07"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR14"] <- "SS07"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR15"] <- "SS08"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR16"] <- "SS08"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR19"] <- "SS10"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR20"] <- "SS10"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR45"] <- "SS23"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR46"] <- "SS23"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR59"] <- "SS30"
senate_clean$Senate_District[senate_clean$House_District == "SR60"] <- "SS30"
senate_clean<-senate_clean%>%
  filter(Senate_District != "None")%>%
  as.tibble()%>%
  select(-c(House_District))
```

After creating the Senate District feature, I could then aggregate by it and create the final Senate dataset that I could pull apart to create individual district time series datasets. 

```{r Cleaning Senate Data, message=FALSE}

senate_clean2<-senate_clean%>%
  group_by(Date,Senate_District)%>%
  mutate(Republican = sum(Republican), 
         Democrat = sum(Democrat),
         Other = sum(Other),
         Independent = sum(Independent),
         Nonaffiliated =  sum(Nonaffiliated))
  

senate_clean2<-senate_clean2%>%
  mutate(District_Total = Democrat + Republican+ Other + Independent+ Nonaffiliated)%>%
  drop_na()%>%
  select(Date,Senate_District, Democrat, Republican, Independent, Nonaffiliated,Other,District_Total)%>%
  unique()

```

Finally, I broke down and created a for loop to go through and pull out all the data for each district and create the five individual datasets. After this step, I could now forecast voter registration for the 2022 Midterm election.

```{r Creating Forecasting Datasets, message=FALSE}

senate_districts_list <- senate_clean2%>% 
  group_by(Senate_District)%>% 
  select(Senate_District)%>%
  unique()%>%
  arrange(Senate_District)
senate_districts_list<-apply(senate_districts_list,1,as.list)
for (val in senate_districts_list) {
temp <- senate_clean2%>%
  filter(Senate_District == val)%>%
  filter(Date != ymd("2017-11-14"))%>%
  mutate(Date = yearmonth(floor_date(as_date(Date), "month")))
name <- paste("District", toString(val), sep = "_")
assign(name,temp)
}

rm(temp,val,name,count,senate_districts_list)

```

### Forecasting

In a previous file, I tested several different time series models including ETS, ARIMA and simple Linear models. Across several of the datasets, I found that ARIMA was most accurate on random samples. As the data is stationary, most of the models were forecasting Naive or Drift models which were accurate, but they weren't capturing any of the error in the data. Overall, the models were incredibly close and the accuracy came down to the size of the window. After looking at the model's accuracy and the relatively long window of 17 months I was forecasting, I ended up choosing the ARIMA model. After choosing that, it just came down to applying the model on each of the parties within each district. On this, I did look into grouped time series methods, however, as I was forecasting the simple number of voters for each party, non-grouped methods are effective. I have also only included the 7th district as the other four districts' code is identical.
